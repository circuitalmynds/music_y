00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.080
Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away

00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:03.760
Your love never fails
I know I still make mistakes

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.100
But You have new mercies for me everyday
Your love never fails

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:26.320
You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.980
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:42.400
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:58.720
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.780
The wind is strong and the water's deep
I'm not alone in these open seas

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:20.180
'Cause Your love never fails
The chasm is far too wide

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.220
I never thought I'd reach the other side
'Cause Your love never fails

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:41.660
'Cause you stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.840
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.240
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:20.800
Because I know that You love me
Oh no, love never fails

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:37.440
'Cause You make all things work together for
my good

00:03:37.440 --> 00:04:06.320
You make all things work together for my good
You make all things work together for my good

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.800
You make all things work together for my good
You make all things work together for my good

'Cause you stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes

It may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:39.840
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid

00:04:39.840 --> 00:05:18.320
